This is initially a semi-guided project from Code Academy. I added some fun by implementing additional arguments to the plotting functions:

- Easily exclude (or not) outliers from histograms
- Eeasily (again!) set the limit of scatter plots to manually "exclude" outliers, or "zoom" on portions of the distributions
- Pass variable more flexibly than in the initial exercise
